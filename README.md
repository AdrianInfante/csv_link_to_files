Getting Started
These instructions will guide you through setting up and using the script on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.6 or higher
requests library
pandas library
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests pandas
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repository-name
Usage
Prepare your CSV file: Ensure your CSV file is formatted correctly and includes a column with URLs. Update the script with the correct path to your CSV file and the column name containing URLs.

Set the download directory: In the script, specify the path to the directory where you want the files to be downloaded.

Run the script: Execute the script using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python extractURLfromCSV.py
Check the output: The files from the URLs will be downloaded to the specified directory.

Script Details
File: extractURLfromCSV.py
Description: This script reads a CSV file, extracts URLs from a specified column, and downloads each file to a local directory.
How the Script Works
Reading the CSV File: The script uses the pandas library to read the CSV file into a DataFrame.
Extracting URLs: It iterates over each row, extracts the URL from the specified column, and sends a GET request using the requests library.
Downloading Files: The script saves each file to the specified local directory, handling various file types and names.
Error Handling: The script includes error handling for issues like invalid URLs, network errors, and missing directories.
Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a snippet of the core functionality:

python
Copy code
# Read the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)

# Iterate through the rows of the DataFrame
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    url = row['URLs']  # Replace with the actual column name

    try:
        # Download the file
        response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
        response.raise_for_status()

        # Save the file locally
        file_name = os.path.basename(url)
        file_path = os.path.join(download_directory, file_name)

        with open(file_path, 'wb') as f:
            for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
                f.write(chunk)

        print(f"Downloaded: {file_name}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error downloading {url}: {e}")
Troubleshooting
FileNotFoundError: Ensure that the download directory exists and is correctly specified in the script.
KeyError: Verify that the column name for URLs in the CSV matches the one used in the script.
Invalid URLs: Check the URLs in the CSV file for correctness and accessibility.
